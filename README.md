## Architecture
The architecture of the portfolio website deployment on AWS involves the following components:
- Route53: Acts as the DNS service for the website, enabling users to access it via a user-friendly domain name.
- CloudFront: Utilized as a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute the website's content globally, reducing latency and enhancing performance.
- S3 Bucket: Stores the static assets of the website, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files.
- ReactJS: The frontend of the website is built using ReactJS, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- EmailJS: Integrated for handling contact form submissions, allowing users to send messages directly from the website.

## Workflow
